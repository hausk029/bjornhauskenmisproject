                    <h3> My Stock Market Journey</h3>
                    <p>My journey in the stock market began with a simple desire to understand how money grows and moves. Through each trade, I like to explore the patterns behind market trends, the stories driving companies, and fundamentals behind each company. Every stock represents a unique opportunity at any given time.</p>

                        <p> Money and the way businesses run has always been an interest of mine. I'm particularly interested in the numbers side of businesses and the key data that makes businesses grow. My Grandma has been into the stock market and she was the one who introduced me into it. She showed me how to dive into the numbers behind each stock and I love doing this research and coming up with new ideas with her.</p>

                    <p>My journey in following sports began with a simple love for competition and the pure emotion behind every game. That love deepened when I discovered strategy. Now every game, I enjoy exploring the strategies that each team implements. Lastly, I love to dive into the numbers, like the stats and records of players and teams. I love analyzing player performance and team dynamics to gain a deeper understanding of the game.</p>

                        <p>Growing up I enjoyed playing sports, especially the competitive aspect of it. Baseball in particular has always been a favorite of mine. My parents took me to a lot of Twins games as a kid and those experiences are cherished memories of mine. Last year, my dad and I went to the East Coast and attended games for the Red Sox, Phillies, Orioles, and Nationals. It is my goal one day to have visited each MLB stadium.</p>

                    <p>These activities are important to me because of who I associate them with. I associate the stock market with my Grandma because of how much she got me into it and through the years we have taught each other more about it. With sports I have made memories with friends and family. Even now, I love to watch and analyze games and talk about them with my friends and family. Not only do I enjoy these hobbies, but they also strengthen my connections with loved ones.</p>
